# TestingGrounds
Testing Grounds is a first person shooter that tasks the player with surviving through "testing grounds" which are areas where the player has to complete a specific objective to continue to the next area.
This is going to be based on the [UDemy Unreal course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview).
